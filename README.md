Project Title: KEYBOARDING

Description:
How many keystrokes are necessary to type a text message? You may think that it is equal to the number of characters in the text, but this is correct only if one keystroke generates one character.

One mechanism to deal with these limitations is a virtual keyboard displayed on a screen, with a cursor that can be
moved from key to key to select characters. Four arrow buttons control the movement of the cursor, and when the cursor is positioned over an appropriate key, pressing the fifth button selects the corresponding character and appends it to the end of the text. 

To terminate the text, the user must navigate to and select the Enter key.


In this problem, you are given a virtual keyboard layout and your task is to determine the minimal number of strokes needed to type a given text, where pressing any of the five hardware buttons constitutes a stroke. 
The keys are arranged in a rectangular grid, such that each virtual key occupies one or more connected unit squares of the grid.


Example - 1

Sample Input:
4 7
ABCDEFG
HIJKLMN
OPQRSTU
VWXYZ**


For the word: CONTEST



Sample Output:
30 -- the number of minimum strokes required for the word CONTEST is 30.

Example - 2

Sample Input 2:

5 20
12233445566778899000

 For the Word : ACM-ICPC-WORLD-FINALS-2015


 Sample Output2: 
 
 160 -- the number of minimum strokes required for the given word according virtual keyboard2 is 160.


 TECHNOLOGIES USED:  PYTHON3  
 
 python is very flexible for beginners when we doing project for the first time. So we choose python to implement this project.

 CHALLENGES:
 
 It was our first python project so we faced many challenges while working with coding part. It took one day to understand the problem.
 
 INSTALL AND RUN THE PROJECT:
 
 We use visual studio code to implement and run the code. To run our project you just need VS code and extension PYTHON.
 
 HOW TO USE THE PROJECT:
 
 Our project is very simple based on the virtual keyboard it gives you the minimal strokes required for a word.
